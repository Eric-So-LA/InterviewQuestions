How would you deal with scalability?
With my server loaded on an AWS EC2 instance, there are several options to making sure it scales well with more and more users.

If I am using an Elastic Bean stalk, I can resize the instance when i find that demand is getting too big or too small for the size of my instance. Additionally, EBS can implement load balancing which means it will take requests from a server that is backed up and give those requests to a different server.

EBS handles the load balancing and auto scaling of the application.

I have not had the need for EBS yet as I was making small open source applications. But I've been looking forward to deploying an app that has EBS implemented
